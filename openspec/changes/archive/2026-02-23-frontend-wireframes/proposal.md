## Why

The frontend scaffold spec defines what screens exist but not how they look or behave in detail. To build the actual UI, developers need wireframe-level descriptions: exact layouts, component hierarchies, interaction patterns, empty states, loading states, and responsive breakpoints for every screen.

## What Changes

- Detailed wireframe spec for every screen in the application
- Component hierarchy and layout descriptions
- Interaction patterns and micro-interactions
- Loading, empty, and error states
- Mobile vs. desktop layout differences

## Capabilities

### Modified Capabilities
- `frontend-scaffold`: Extended with wireframe-level detail for all screens

## Impact

- Extends the existing frontend-scaffold spec with implementation-ready wireframe descriptions
- No code changes — this is a specification document for UI implementation
