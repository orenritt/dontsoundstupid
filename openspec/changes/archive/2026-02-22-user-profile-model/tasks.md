## 1. User Profile Schema

- [x] 1.1 Create TypeScript interfaces for the identity layer (user profile, enriched person, company enrichment)
- [x] 1.2 Create TypeScript interfaces for the context layer (initiatives, concerns, topics, knowledge gaps)
- [x] 1.3 Create TypeScript interfaces for peer organizations (suggestion, confirmation, comment)
- [x] 1.4 Create the unified UserProfile type combining both layers + impress list + peers
- [x] 1.5 Add JSON Schema generation or validation setup

## 2. Onboarding Conversation Flow

- [x] 2.1 Define the onboarding step types/interfaces (step 1-5 data shapes)
- [x] 2.2 Create the conversation script — questions, prompts, and expected response shapes for each step
- [x] 2.3 Define the flow logic — step ordering, what triggers the peer org research step

## 3. Verify

- [x] 3.1 Ensure the schema covers all fields from the specs
- [x] 3.2 Ensure the onboarding flow maps to all five steps in the spec
